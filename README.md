This is a final project of Coursera's IBM Machine Learning: Regression. </br>
Arranged by Yohanes Setiawan.

# **Business Understanding**

## Introduction
- 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. 
- A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.

## Problem Statement

Passengers are difficult to calculate a range of ticket price to make better plan for their trip
